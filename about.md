It’s been a very long time since there was a decent Perl book that covered web development. Which means that people are often learning Perl web development using books that are fifteen years old.

Perl web development has moved on a lot since then and people who follow these out of date books will be picking up many bad habits.

So this project is an attempt to fix this problem. I’m writing a new book about Perl web development in Perl.
