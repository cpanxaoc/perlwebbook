# Underlying Tools

All of the web development mechanisms that we will cover use many of the
same underlying tools. To avoid repetition, we will introduce some of the 
most importan of these tools in this chapter.

* Perl is the programming language that we will use for the web-server side
code in all of our examples.

* Moose (and its cut-down cousin, Moo) gives a simple and powerful way to 
write Object-Oriented code in Perl.

* The Template Toolkit is a great way to separate the parts of our code that
display data to the users from the parts which work out what we need to show
to the users.

* DBIx::Class is used to communicate with a database.

* PSGI is a specification that defines the interaction between a web server
and a web application. It's like a super-charged version of CGI. Plack is a
toolkit for working with that specification.
